{section: Verse 1}
Come Thou fount of every blessing
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace
Streams of mercy never ceasing
Call for songs of loudest praise
Teach me some melodious sonnet
Sung by flaming tongues above
Praise the mount Im fixed upon it
Mount of Thy redeeming love

{section: Verse 2}
Here I raise my Ebenezer
Hither by Thy help Ive come
And I hope by Thy good pleasure
Safely to arrive at home
Jesus sought me when a stranger
Wandering from the fold of God
He to rescue me from danger
Interposed His precious blood

{section: Verse 3}
O to grace how great a debtor
Daily Im constrained to be
Let Thy goodness like a fetter
Bind my wandering heart to Thee
Prone to wander Lord I feel it
Prone to leave the God I love
Heres my heart O take and seal it
Seal it for Thy courts above
