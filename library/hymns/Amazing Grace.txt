{section: Verse 1}
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now am found
Was blind but now I see

{section: Verse 2}
Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

{section: Verse 3}
Through many dangers toils and snares
I have already come
Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

{section: Verse 4}
When weve been there ten thousand years
Bright shining as the sun
Weve no less days to sing Gods praise
Than when wed first begun
